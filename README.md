# Machine Learning 
This repository contains comprehensive solutions to assignments from the "Machine Learning from Data" course.
The solutions cover essential machine learning topics, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Bayesian learning, the Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
Additionally, the assignments explore advanced concepts like PAC Learning, VC Dimension, and clustering techniques such as k-means.
Each solution is implemented in Python, utilizing object-oriented principles and leveraging the sklearn library for practical application.
These solutions not only demonstrate proficiency in theoretical understanding but also in applying these algorithms to real-world datasets, showcasing the ability to evaluate and critique results effectively.
